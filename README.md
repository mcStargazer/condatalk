Support for OKC Python User's Group Talk 2015-11-11. Talk entitled, Anaconda/Conda: A platform for replicable science with Python and “The Others”.

Useful links for exploring Anaconda/Miniconda/Conda are as follows, and I quote:
* bit.ly/condaquickinstall to get it.
* bit.ly/tryconda has a 30 minute test drive.
* continuum.io/content/conda-data-science contains a data science tutorial
* continuum.io/why-anaconda has general advocacy
